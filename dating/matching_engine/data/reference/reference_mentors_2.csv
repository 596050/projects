1,"Considering my professional experience, I can contribute with any public interactions that the startups have to deal, such as licensing, taxation or public funding. Also, if the area of the company underpins with participatory actions (policies, development, social business), I believe that my backgrounds can help a new point of view about their practices. 

Furthermore, my specialisation in business management allows me to give advice in any area related to strategy, basic finances and human resources management, canvas, business plan, etc. To finish, the development of my Masters already permits me support any company that works with sustainability, energy and related areas.  ","Sustainability and public policies. I really believe that we need to improve our process, independent of which sector the company is focused. We have a huge opportunity to do more using less, amplifying the quality of the services and how we interact with our natural capital. ","First of all, I will just introduce myself. I'm Brazilian, 26 years old and doing an MSc in Economics, Policy of Energy and the Environment at UCL. I'm also a Chevening scholar , a programme created by the UK Government to allow leaders from developing countries doing Masters in the UK with the focus of fostering the growth of their areas after concluding the studies. 

My backgrounds are in Public Administration, in which I have a bachelor, and Business Management, in which I have a specialisation. As a specialist in public policies and governmental management, I have worked for 4 years in my state government. Considering that my career was created to be a generalist expert in public policies, I had the opportunity to work in many areas, such as education, culture, economic development and participatory policies. In addition, I was volunteer in AIESEC (a platform to develop young leadership through exchanges) which helped me to improve my skills as a manager. 

I believe that I have the potential to help the Bridges for Enterprises with my past experience and knowledge. Although my professional background is in the public sector, I had the possibility to work with many companies in the private sector, and a fast experience in the startup programme of my state (SEED-MG). My willingness is to help the companies to foster their development, adding my expertise, and also learning with them new models of business."

16,"I thought I might start with a series of more tangible skills. I have a solid financial background having worked at HSBC for the past six years. In conjunction with my job I have also taken and passed the CFA Level 1 and recently finished the first year of a Part-Time Masters in Finance at London Business School. That Masters programme has involved numerous modules centred around running and optimising businesses that range from accounting modules to corporate finance and investment theory. Outside of finance I also speak fluent German and have an A-Level in French.

To turn now to the less tangible skills. I hope that having spent a large portion of my life abroad I have developed the means of communicating effectively and empathising with others. I am lucky enough to have had the chance to be part of a team and lead one and am both patient and highly motivated.
","I am interested in a wide range of different sectors and social causes. There are certain sectors that I have focused on professionally, including renewable energy businesses and social housing. Those are two areas I spent a lot of time looking at when I was at HSBC in London and have continued to work on out here in New Zealand. Then there are other social causes that I have a personal affinity towards. I have always been drawn towards helping children and that explains the work I have done for Barnardos. My girlfriend is also a doctor and so having been exposed to medicine for the past ten years that is an area that interests me greatly.
","I was lucky enough to spend the first eighteen years of my life living abroad. Mum and dad passed through Hong Kong, Frankfurt and New York before ending up in the UK just as it came time for me to go to university. I did a degree in Modern Languages (German) at Oxford University and it was during my year abroad in Germany that I first got a taste for finance. I spent some time working at both HSBC and The Economist before then applying to join the HSBC graduate programme in 2012. I joined what was the Global Markets programme before ending up in Debt Capital Markets. I have since been focused on helping corporates across a broad range of industries formulate and structure their funding strategies. I was based in London until last September when I was given the chance to move out to New Zealand for twelve months to help build up HSBC's broader debt business here. That has put me into contact with a different set of businesses, some of which are multi-nationals and others of which are start-ups looking to build their presence.

In conjunction with the work I have done at HSBC I have also always tried to do as much socially focused work as possible. That has included charitable work for the likes of Barnardos here in Wellington and the Order of Malta in London. I have also taught English at a school in Slough and had the chance to help HSBC grow its relationship with Sponsors for Educational Opportunities. That has let me see how smaller and less bureaucratic institutions operate and to involve myself in strictly non-financial projects.

I would love to be able to use some of the skills and experiences I am lucky enough to have had to help others and give back in any way possible."
